How does National Curriculum work?
The National Curriculum is constructed in five Key Stages (**KS**):

KS1 - Foundation year and Years [1, 2] - for pupils aged between 5 and 7 years old.  
KS2 - Years [3, 4, 5, 6] - for pupils aged between 8 and 11 years old.  
KS3 - Years [7, 8, 9] - for pupils aged between 12 and 14 years old.  
KS4 - Years [10, 11] - for pupils aged between 15 and 16 years old.  
KS5 - Years [12, 13] - for pupils aged between 17 and 18 years old.

In state schools each year that a pupil studies is given a number.  
_Primary education_ starts in Year 1.  
_Seconday education_ starts at the age of 11 (Year 7) for most pupils, but in some HMC schools pupils join the school at 13+ (Year 9).

At the age of 16 (the end of KS4 and Year 11), all pupils take a series of exams called the General Certificate of Secondary Education (**GCSE**), usually in about eight to ten subjects, which must include English and Mathematics.

KS5 is for pupils aged 16-18 (sometimes 19) and most schools take Advanced Level (**A-Levels**) exams after a two-year course.
