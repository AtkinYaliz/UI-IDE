## What is AI?

### Software that imitates human capabilities
-	Predicting outcomes and recognising patterns based on historic data
-	Recognising abnormal events and making decisions
-	Interpret visual input
-	Understanding language and engaging in conversation
- Extract information from sources to gain knowledge 

### Common AI Workloads:

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Our aim is to create predictive models based on data and statistics - the foundation for AI
- **Anomaly Detection:** Systems that detect unusual patterns or events, enabling pre-emptive action
- **Computer Vision:** Applications that interpret visual input from cameras, images, or videos
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Applications that can interpret written or spoken language, and engage in dialogs with human users
- **Knowledge Mining:** Extract information from data sources to create a searcable knowledge store

**What is Machine Learning?**
Think about traditional programming. The idea in a traditional programming model is the programmer thinks about what this program has to do and they have to provide the code or the instruction or an algorithm to teach to computer how to execute a task. And, any input we provide is subsequently go through the algorithm designed by the programmer and the output is going to come out.
Machine learning however, is creating a predictive model by finding relationships in data. We are providing data, which is both the input and the output to the computer and letting the computer think for itself and come up with the algorithm. This algorithm is not done by the computer. That is the ML model.
