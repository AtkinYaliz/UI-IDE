Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This preview provides the following features inside VS Code:

* Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
* Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
* Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono and Desktop CLR debugging is not supported.
* Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

### What's New in 1.12.0

* Support for C# 7.1.
* Support for latest .NET Core 2.0 preview.
* Improvements to our support for Xamarin projects.
* Several improvements to code actions, plus several new code fixes and refactorings.
* The completion list now suggests variable names as you type.
* Many other bug fixes

See our [change log](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/v1.12.0/CHANGELOG.md) for all of the updates.

### Supported Operating Systems for Debugging

* Currently, the C# debugger officially supports the following operating systems:

  * Windows (64-bit only)
  * macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and newer
  * Ubuntu 14.04+ (and distros based on it)
  * Debian 8.7+
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) / CentOS / Oracle Linux 7.3+
  * Fedora 23 / 24 / 25
  * OpenSUSE 42.2+

This list is currently the same as the x64 .NET Core 2.0 operating systems (see [.NET Core list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md#net-core-20---supported-os-versions)). Note that other Linux distributions will likely work as well as long as they include glibc, OpenSSL 1.0, and libunwind.
