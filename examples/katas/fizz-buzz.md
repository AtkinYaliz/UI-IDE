Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "_Fizz_" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "_Buzz_".  
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "_FizzBuzz_".

__Stage 2 - new requirements__  
A number is _fizz_ if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it  
A number is _buzz_ if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it  

For exemple:  
53 should return _FizzBuzz_ (contain 5 and 3)  
35 should return _FizzBuzzBuzz_ (contain 3 and 5 and it divided by 5)
