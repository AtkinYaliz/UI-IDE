Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This preview provides the following features inside VS Code:

* Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
* Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
* Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono and Desktop CLR debugging is not supported.
* Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

### Get Started Writing C# in VS Code

* [Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp)
* [Video Tutorial compiling with .NET Core](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-using-CSharp-and-NET-Core)

### What's New in 1.13.0

* Support for Cake files. (https://cakebuild.net/)
* The language service now runs on Mono >= 5.2.0 when it is globally installed on macOS or Linux, resulting faster project load times.
* If debugging is started when a launch.json is not present, picking ".NET Core" generates a launch.json dynamically that can correctly launch a .NET Core app without any additional changes.
* Better reliability loading projects when Visual Studio 2017 (Windows) or Mono >= 5.2.0 (macOS/Linux) is installed.
* Fixed issues with non-C# projects (such as F#) being treated as C# projects.
* Addressed bugs when renaming files.
* New options for controlling the display of the references and test CodeLens:
  * `csharp.referencesCodeLens.enabled`
  * `csharp.testsCodeLens.enabled`
* Fixed problems with running/debugging xUnit 2.3.0 or NUnit tests.
* Many other bug fixes!

See our [change log](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/v1.13.0/CHANGELOG.md) for all of the updates.

### Supported Operating Systems for Debugging

* Currently, the C# debugger officially supports the following operating systems:

  * Windows (64-bit only)
  * macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and newer
  * Ubuntu 14.04+ (and distros based on it)
  * Debian 8.7+
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) / CentOS / Oracle Linux 7.3+
  * Fedora 23 / 24 / 25
  * OpenSUSE 42.2+

This list is currently the same as the x64 .NET Core 2.0 operating systems (see [.NET Core list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md#net-core-20---supported-os-versions)). Note that other Linux distributions will likely work as well as long as they include glibc, OpenSSL 1.0, and libunwind.
