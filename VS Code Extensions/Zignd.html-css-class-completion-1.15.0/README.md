## Usage
If there are HTML or JS files on your workspace, the extension automatically starts and looks for CSS class definitions. In case new CSS classes are defined, or new CSS files are added to the workspace, and you also want auto-completion for them, just hit the lightning icon on the status bar. Also, you can execute the command by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`(`cmd+Shift+P` for Mac) and then typing "Cache CSS class definitions."

### User Settings
You can change the folders and files the extension will consider or exclude during the caching process by setting the following User Settings:

* `html-css-class-completion.includeGlobPattern` (default: "**/*.{css,html}")
* `html-css-class-completion.excludeGlobPattern` (default: "")

For now, you will have to hit the lightning icon so the changes can be recognized.
