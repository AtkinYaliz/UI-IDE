## What is AI?

### Software that imitates human capabilities
-	Predicting outcomes and recognising patterns based on historic data
-	Recognising abnormal events and making decisions
-	Interpret visual input
-	Understanding language and engaging in conversation
- Extract information from sources to gain knowledge 

### Common AI Workloads:

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Our aim is to create predictive models based on data and statistics - the foundation for AI
- **Anomaly Detection:** Systems that detect unusual patterns or events, enabling pre-emptive action
- **Computer Vision:** Applications that interpret visual input from cameras, images, or videos
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Applications that can interpret written or spoken language, and engage in dialogs with human users
- **Knowledge Mining:** Extract information from data sources to create a searcable knowledge store
